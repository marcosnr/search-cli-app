check export to json (no test) and modify prompt

check no clash org with org same name in linking!
check FKs are present at load time
add readme does not support tags [] empty (I asked!)
check if result too big default to json file
README:
complete setup
complete usage and assumptions: returns only first hit

check with real data? python app/search_cli.py users --field '_id' --value 1

Why logging, security, ci is job 0, bandit, commit signed
ctl getting big, could be modularise further
for UX purposes, some prints are in ctl layer, they should not be there, but would required a bit of refactoring

NOT_SO_CORE:
repeated items by id
complete tests for validator and ctl

ask if needs only name id or full result (for org would be big result)

Validate:
id string is number is UUID xcheck
items with no iditems with no fk!
Custom  exceptions for not found and handling
makefile validate prereqs

import:
interface to load other input from the given one

export:
append timesatamp to export json file
beeprint not good, prettyprint better

ci:
create github action pipeline
create bin exec
testing:
use mocks

enhancements:
search for a user field inside an org (recursive search)
search by time range
code more DRY
cli tests capturing ouptut print
ascii art, it's but one line in the exporter!
