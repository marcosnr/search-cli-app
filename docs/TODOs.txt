append timesatamp to export json file
beeprint not good, prettyprint better

create github action pipeline
create bin exec

use mocks

enhancements:
search by time range
code more DRY
cli tests capturing ouptut print

README:

complete setup
complete usage and assumptions: returns only first hit
Why logging, security, ci is job 0, bandit, commit signed
ctl getting big, could be modularise further
for UX purposes, some prints are in ctl layer, they should not be there, but would required a bit of refactoring
